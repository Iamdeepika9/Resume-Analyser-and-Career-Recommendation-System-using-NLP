# Resume Analyser and Career Recommendation System using NLP

## 📌 Abstract
Massive volumes of resumes may cause a challenge in the recruitment process since recruiters spend lots of time and effort manually assessing applicants. Besides, some applicants are not well advised on how to optimize their resumes for applicant tracking systems, nor do they get ideas about which careers would suit them.  

This project solves such challenges by automating and advancing traditional resume analysis methods with efficient and accurate candidate review and personalized career recommendations.  

The proposed solution utilizes **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to extract key information from resumes, including personal details, education, work experience, and skills. Unstructured resume data is fed into the system, processed, and converted into a structured format before being stored for further review.  

It aligns candidate profiles with job descriptions on the basis of extracted skills and experiences, thereby streamlining and making the recruitment process precise. Moreover, it offers candidates actionable recommendations such as:
- Skill enhancements  
- Certifications  
- Resume improvements  

This solution not only reduces the workload of the recruiter but also empowers applicants to align their profiles with market requirements. By automating **resume parsing, job-role matching, and career recommendations**, it fosters an efficient, scalable, and fair hiring process while helping individuals enhance their employability and achieve their professional goals.  


## 🚩 Problem Statement
In large organizations where applicant numbers are massive, recruiters spend considerable time manually assessing thousands of resumes to select the best candidates for a job. This traditional approach is time-consuming and prone to bias.  

The problem addressed in this project is **automating the recruitment process** using an **AI-based Resume Parser and Analyzer powered by NLP techniques**.
